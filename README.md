my screeps 

I think it's time to get my scripts into github and working properly with an IDE after playing around in the console for 133 hours :).

Hope you find something useful along the journey with me and feel free to come with suggestions.

It's a mess at the moment. Hope to organise and optimise the code now I can see more than 10 lines at a time...
